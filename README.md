# War

A project I am using for practicing typescript.

The card game War is about two players who will split a deck of cards and compete to see who can win all of the cards. Both players play the top card of their deck and compare to see who has the highest card, the winner takes the loser's card and places it at the bottom of their deck as well as their own winning card. When the players flip over cards of the same value, a war begins! In a war both players will draw three cards and place them face down close to their first card, then both players draw another card face up with the winner getting all the cards to place in their deck. If the players tie in a war, another war happens and so on until a player wins. A player wins the entire game when they have all the cards in their deck.
